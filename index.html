Hii this is me Nitya, yet introducing myself again.
I’m glad that I’m back to writing all over it reminds me of my initial days in SHEILD.
I’ve been a part of this beautiful organisation for more than a year now and for the changed person I think I am now SHEILD has played a major.
I expect all the new recruiters of this semester to actually take me as an example to learn and grow in this organisation, if a person like me with low knowledge about startups could come this far  by learning ,you guys can go way ahead than me.
It’s not going to be easy but learning, mistakes, clash of ideas, arguments, falling apart, failures, success are all going to be a part of this journey for you all this year. Take this an opportunity to find out who you really are, where your interest lies and what you’re good at.
SHEILD has been a very successful organisation in any many aspects and has given very good events for the fests.
 Hopefully SHEILD will continue to conduct successful events, help the startups that will emerge in VIT and create efficient entrepreneurs.

           <h5>Ajinkya</h5> <br>
Hi, Ajinkya here. I’m glad to write to you and I want to thank the board to give me some space here. S.H.E.I.L.D has been a life changing journey for me. I travelled through all ups and downs and learnt life lessons, found my passion and transformed from a shy introvert to a so called ‘social’ person. 
<br>
I have always expected this organization to be a platform where you can explore yourself and understand your potential. Every one of you is a ‘gem’. Just use this place to find your colour. You will have to create opportunities for yourself, work hard and smart. You might not always get the desired success but I’ve always said that the journey always matter more than the results. 
<br>
Travel through this organization over the next two years, explore it and help forming it. The best part of it is that it’s new, and I expect it always stays new. You get to run, alter things that support you. And believe me if it supports you, it supports the club. Your growth is clubs growth because it’s you who forms the club and is the club.  
<br>
Starting from seeding this organization to handing it over, I had a lot of different phases, some tough, some enjoyable and some really difficult. I went on and created memories. Infinite memories to cherish and it all comes before me this very time. 
<br>
I hope you can explore yourself and this club to the maximum and gain life changing experience.
<br>
I hope you are ready.
Love you all.

           <br>
           Congratulations Public Relations! This is the first when we have seen such an amazing PR team. It used to take us months to do the kind of work that you've accomplished this month. You've set a really high expectations for the other departhment's to live upto.
            <br>
            <br>
I really wanted to be the VP of marketing, because I loved the team. When I was made VP of PR, I never expected the team to be anything like marketing. But over the course of time I have realised that this team, can do wonders. This might be the first time the PR team will be able to get sponsorship. The way this team has worked for the past weeks, has made me fall in love with them. They have shown me that they are capable of doing wonders. The honour of being the best department, will only fuel us more for the journey ahead. And we will make SHEILD proud of us, as I am proud of my marvellous team.

I believe SHEILD is a club like none other. It’s an organisation which focuses a lot on member Development, has a very systematic way of working and also helps you build confidence and to trust in your abilities to achieve whatever you want. All while focusing a lot on inculcating the skills required to be an entrepreneur in you guys.
I expect all of you to feel a sense of ownership towards the club and always look forward to learning new things and benefit as much as you can from SHEILD.
I myself was clueless about how to work when I first joined the organization. I saw most of my peers getting recognized by seniors for their work and kind of felt unnoticed. However, all that changed when I got into the events team and all my inputs really started to matter and my whole journey has been with a crazy amount of ups and downs which has taught me most of the things I feel I know about management. Also, it has created a liking towards entrepreneurship in me.
At the end of the day my aim for SHEILD is to be a platform which startups can approach if they are looking for any sort of help.
